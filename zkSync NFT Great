# NFT zkSync Integration Project

Welcome to the NFT zkSync Integration Project! This project demonstrates the integration of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) with zkSync, a layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum.

## Overview

This project consists of two main Solidity smart contracts:

1. **MyZkSyncNFT.sol**: This contract allows users to mint NFTs and transfer them to zkSync for scalability.

2. **ZkSyncNFTMarketplace.sol**: A simple NFT marketplace contract where users can list their NFTs for sale and others can purchase them using cryptocurrency.

## Contracts

### MyZkSyncNFT.sol

This contract allows users to mint NFTs and transfer them to zkSync. Each NFT minting is tracked, and only the minter can transfer the NFT to zkSync.

#### Functions:

- `mintNFT()`: Mint a new NFT.
- `transferNFTToZkSync(uint256 tokenId)`: Transfer a specific NFT to zkSync.

### ZkSyncNFTMarketplace.sol

This contract facilitates the buying and selling of NFTs using cryptocurrency. NFTs are listed for sale, and buyers can purchase them, triggering zkSync integration.

#### Functions:

- `listNFTForSale(uint256 tokenId, uint256 price)`: List an NFT for sale.
